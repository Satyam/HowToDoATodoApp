# HowToDoATodoApp

Sample code for the book **How to do a Todo App** available in [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/howtodoatodoapp) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Satyam/HowToDoATodoApp-book).

Sample code for each successive chapter can be displayed by selecting it from the <kbd>Branch: **master**</kbd> dropdown list at the top left of the file listing box.  

Once a chapter (branch) is selected, the full code for that chapter can be downloaded as a compressed `.zip` file with the <kbd>Download ZIP</kbd> button.

The whole repository can be cloned, provided you have a local git client software installed by doing:

 `git clone https://github.com/Satyam/HowToDoATodoApp.git`

 That will create a `HowToDoATodoApp` folder under your current working directory.  Do a `cd HowToDoATodoApp` and then you can see all the work at any stage for any chapter just by doing:

 `git checkout chapter-nn`

 To list the chapters available, do:

 `git branch`
